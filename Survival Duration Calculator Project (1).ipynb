    "# Documentation of SURVIVAL DURATION CALCULATOR PROJECT:\n",
    " \n",
    " The provided code is a Python program designed to take a person's name and age as input and then calculate and display the duration of their life in various time units, including months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Below is a detailed documentation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Input Gathering*:\n",
    "   - The program begins by prompting the user to input their name using the `input()` function. The name is stored in the variable `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *User Greeting*:\n",
    "   - After obtaining the user's name, the program greets the user by printing \"Hello\" followed by their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Age Input*:\n",
    "   - The user is then prompted to input their age as an integer using `input()`, which is converted to an integer and stored in the variable `age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Leap Year Calculation*:\n",
    "   - The code calculates the number of leap years the person has lived through. This calculation is based on the number of years divisible by 4 (potential leap years), subtracting those divisible by 100 (except when divisible by 400).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Age Adjustment*:\n",
    "   - The calculated number of leap years (stored in `l`) is then subtracted from the original age to adjust it for leap years. This adjusted age is stored back in the variable `age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Time Unit Calculations*:\n",
    "   - The code performs several calculations to convert the adjusted age into different time units:\n",
    "     - `month`: The number of months the person has lived is calculated by multiplying the adjusted age by 12.\n",
    "     - `week`: The number of weeks is calculated based on the adjusted age and leap years, approximating a year as 52.14 weeks and a leap year as 52.28 weeks.\n",
    "     - `day`: The number of days is calculated based on the adjusted age and leap years, considering a year as 365 days and a leap year as 366 days.\n",
    "     - `hour`: The number of hours is calculated by multiplying the number of days by 24.\n",
    "     - `minn` (likely a typo, should be `min`): The number of minutes is calculated by multiplying the number of hours by 60.\n",
    "     - `sec`: The number of seconds is calculated by multiplying the number of minutes by 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. *Display Results*:\n",
    "   - The code prints out the calculated results for each time unit, indicating how long the person has survived or lived.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. *Main Function Execution*:\n",
    "   - The code defines the `main()` function, but it is not explicitly called. It can be executed by adding the following code at the end:\n",
    "     python\n",
    "     if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "         main()"
